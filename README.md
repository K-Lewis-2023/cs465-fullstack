CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN
(Updated: 8/14/2023 - Kelly Lewis)

Module 8: 8-1 Journal - Portfolio Submission

Updated:
    README.md

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initial Prompt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have completed a working full stack web application that serves both the customer and administrative sides of
the application. In the final iteration, you added security features for the admin login for secure login 
authentication in order to complete the project. As a final way to add polish to the project, you will create a 
README file and reflect on the entire process.

Submit the README file to your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below.
You may include the prompts and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or 
two weaving together all of your answers for each of the sections that correlate to your course competencies.

Architecture
-----------
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including 
	Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

Functionality
-----------
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, 
	and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

Testing
-----------
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the 
	difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, 
	and security in a full stack application.

Reflection
-----------
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, 
	or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

Response
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Full stack development requires the knowledge and utilization of a variety of tools. In the project explored 
in this course I was tasked with using Express HTML, JavaScript, Angular, Node, and MongoDB. While I have had some 
experience implementing and utilizing MongoDB, this course helped to reinforce how MongoDB can be utilized. For the 
frontend, Express HTML, JavaScript, and Angular were used to build the primary web interface, and the administrative 
Single Page Application (SPA). The backend was built upon MongoDB to handle data storage and access.

JSON was used to help communicate information. This file type/ script was used to access and store data. 
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), while based in JS, it is a independent data format that can be used by a variety 
of languages. Whereas JS is a programming language used to create scripts for web applications. Throughout the course 
of the project, code was refactored multiple times to increase security, add functionality, tie in new methods, and 
facilitate communication.

Testing of program functionality required the use of new tools and methods. Some of the tools used were 
Postman, MongoDB Compass, and the implementation of console log outputs to show when checkpoints/ methods were reached. 
This required a new mentality compared to some of the previous test methods that I was used to utilizing. Additionally, 
this created difficulty when attempting automated testing. Additional testing required the use of creating test cases 
and ensuring that the program was secure. Other test cases were designed to check program functionality. Using console 
outputs for when methods were called, accessed, checkpoints throughout the method, and finally when a method was 
complete. Using MongoDB Compass to check the stored or accessed data or using Postman to check communication points. 
Finally, the bulk of testing relied on my creation of test cases for both expected and unexpected user input, and 
program behavior.

This course has shown me a new variety of tools and processes. Also, I gained more experience in program 
structure, best practices, following data flows, diagram creation, test case building, and much more. I would not say 
that I have mastered any skills, however I have more confidence in my ability to problem solve and my overall coding 
knowledge. All of the skills and knowledge gained in the course will help me become more marketable in todayâ€™s job 
market. Angular, Express, MongoDB, JavaScript, Node, Git, and more are currently in demand skills for modern 
programmers, developers, and software engineers.
